# **WIPER SYSTEM**

## INTRODUCTION:

A windscreen wiper, windshield wiper or wiper blade is a device used to remove rain, snow, ice, washer fluid, water, and/or debris from a vehicle's front window. Almost all motor vehicles, including cars, trucks, buses, train locomotives, and watercraft with a cabin—and some aircraft—are equipped with one or more such wipers, which are usually a legal requirement.

A wiper generally consists of a metal arm; one end pivots, the other end has a long rubber blade attached to it. The arm is powered by a motor, often an electric motor, although pneumatic power is also used for some vehicles. The blade is swung back and forth over the glass, pushing water, other precipitation, or any other impediments to visibility, from its surface. On vehicles made after 1969, the speed is normally adjustable, with several continuous speeds, and often one or more intermittent settings. Most personal automobiles use two synchronized radial-type arms, while many commercial vehicles use one or more pantograph arms.

## OBJECTIVE:

The objectives of this project are to upgrade the older cars system by providing automatic wiping system, to design a basic program that will fully operate with the system.

## COMPONENT:

* SMT32 microcontroller board
