# **WIPER SYSTEM**

## INTRODUCTION:

A windscreen wiper, windshield wiper or wiper blade is a device used to remove rain, snow, ice, washer fluid, water, and/or debris from a vehicle's front window. Almost all motor vehicles, including cars, trucks, buses, train locomotives, and watercraft with a cabin—and some aircraft—are equipped with one or more such wipers, which are usually a legal requirement.

A wiper generally consists of a metal arm; one end pivots, the other end has a long rubber blade attached to it. The arm is powered by a motor, often an electric motor, although pneumatic power is also used for some vehicles. The blade is swung back and forth over the glass, pushing water, other precipitation, or any other impediments to visibility, from its surface. On vehicles made after 1969, the speed is normally adjustable, with several continuous speeds, and often one or more intermittent settings. Most personal automobiles use two synchronized radial-type arms, while many commercial vehicles use one or more pantograph arms.

## OBJECTIVE:

The objectives of this project are to upgrade the older cars system by providing automatic wiping system, to design a basic program that will fully operate with the system.

## COMPONENT:

* SMT32 microcontroller board

## BRIEF INTRODUCTION OF COMPONENTS:

## SMT32 MICROCONTROLLER:

STM32 is a family of 32-bit microcontroller integrated circuits by STMicroelectronics. The STM32 chips are grouped into related series that are based around the same 32-bit ARM processor core, such as the Cortex-M33F, Cortex-M7F, Cortex-M4F, Cortex-M3, Cortex-M0+, or Cortex-M0. Internally, each microcontroller consists of the processor core, static RAM, flash memory, debugging interface, and various peripherals.

## LED:

## PUSH BUTTON:

A push button switch controls an action in a machine or other type of process.

Most push button switches function in the same way. Pressure is placed on the button or actuator, resulting in the depression of the internal spring and contacts and the touching of stable contacts at the bottom of the switch. This process will either close or open the electrical circuit. The repeat application of pressure will cause the spring to retract and alter the status of the push button connection.

You can choose between push buttons featuring normally open or closed contacts, which change state upon actuation. Continual pressure must be maintained on the button of a momentary switch to prompt the action. However, it will remain in a stable state within a latching push button until pressure is reapplied.
